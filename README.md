Report Smart Contract

A smart contract is a self-executing contract in which the conditions of the buyer-seller agreement are directly encoded into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained within it are dispersed and decentralized over a blockchain network. Transactions are trackable and irreversible, and the code controls the execution.

Smart contracts allow trustworthy transactions and agreements to be carried out between disparate, anonymous individuals without the requirement for a centralized authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.

The ideal development will be Truffle, which leverages web3.js, is the most popular Ethereum programming framework. Hardhat (formerly known as Buidler) is the second most popular, and we examine its most typical use using ethers.js. Each has their own set of strengths, and it is advantageous to be familiar with all of them. Create, test, and deploy smart contracts with Truffle and Hardhat.

In a blockchain system, a single error might lose you all of your cash - or, worse, the funds of your users! Smart contract unit testing consists of a series of tiny, targeted tests that each validate a specific portion of your contract. They are frequently written in single lines that comprise a specification, such as 'the admin can halt the contract,' 'transferring tokens emits an event,' or 'non-admins cannot mint additional tokens.'

On my setup I havenâ€™t done any unit test or use those frameworks, my stack azura VM, infura, and github with my code in there, also remix to check the contract.
